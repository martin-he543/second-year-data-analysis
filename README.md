# Second Year Data Analysis

## Welcome to my Second Year Data Analysis Code Repository!
There's lots to see and do in this merry land. Special thanks to the Python ```uncertainties``` package for eliminating the need for me to ever calculate uncertainties by hand. If you don't already have this package installed, or for some reason use Sypder, go to your Terminal on your respective operating system (on Windows, this is Win+R, then type ```cmd```; on Mac, this is Cmd+Space, then type ```terminal```), and type the following command:

```
pip install uncertainties
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python
```
Alternatively, in Anaconda, type:
```
conda install uncertainties
conda install pillow
conda install opencv-python
```
